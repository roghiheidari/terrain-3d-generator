# 🎯 START HERE - Your 3D Terrain Models

## ✅ READY TO USE FILES

### 🏆 **terrain_utm.obj** (RECOMMENDED) ⭐ NEW
**Open this file in Photoshop - Real UTM coordinates**

- ✅ Full high resolution (1,008,581 vertices)
- ✅ **Real UTM coordinates** (833m × 1653m)
- ✅ **Correct orientation** (North/East aligned)
- ✅ **Accurate distances** in meters
- ✅ Zonemap colors baked into vertices
- ✅ Centered at origin for easy viewing

**How to open:**
1. Launch Photoshop
2. **File → Open**
3. Select `terrain_utm.obj`
4. Done! Colors will display with real scale

### 🏆 **terrain_utm.stl** (FOR 3D PRINTING)
**Import this into your slicer**

- ✅ Real-world scale (833m × 1653m × 6.7m)
- ✅ Standard binary STL format
- ✅ Ready for Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.

### 📦 **terrain_simple.obj** (Alternative - Normalized)
**Compact version with normalized coordinates**

- ✅ Same colors and resolution
- ✅ Normalized to -1 to 1 range
- ✅ Easier for simple viewers
- ⚠️ Loses real-world scale

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

### Your QGIS File (`files/Zonemap3D.obj`)
The file you generated in QGIS had these problems:

1. ❌ **Negative indices** - Causes errors in many viewers
2. ❌ **External texture** - Requires separate JPG file
3. ❌ **Texture not applied** - Shows white terrain (your screenshot)

**This is why you saw**: White terrain mesh + separate colored plane

### The Fix
I created new files that:
- ✅ Read your DEM and zonemap directly from TIF files
- ✅ Bake colors into vertex data (no external files)
- ✅ Use positive indices only (maximum compatibility)
- ✅ Properly filter nodata values (-32767)

## 🎨 Your Terrain Colors

The model uses 5 colors from your zonemap:

- 🟠 **Zone 0**: Orange (255, 140, 0)
- 🟡 **Zone 1**: Yellow (255, 255, 0)
- 🟢 **Zone 2**: Green (0, 200, 0)
- 🟠 **Zone 3**: Light Orange (255, 165, 0)
- 🟡 **Zone 4**: Yellow-Green (200, 200, 0)

## 🔄 Need Different Settings?

### Change Vertical Exaggeration

Edit `create_simple_terrain.py` line 236:
```python
Z_SCALE = 0.3  # Change this number
```

- `0.1` = Very flat
- `0.3` = Current (moderate)
- `0.5` = More dramatic
- `1.0` = Full range

Then run:
```powershell
conda activate gdal_env
python create_simple_terrain.py
```

### Change Colors

Edit `ZONE_COLORS` dictionary in `create_simple_terrain.py`:
```python
ZONE_COLORS = {
    0: (255, 140, 0),   # Change these RGB values
    1: (255, 255, 0),
    2: (0, 200, 0),
    # ...
}
```

### Reduce File Size

Edit line 235:
```python
DOWNSAMPLE = 2  # 2=half res, 4=quarter res
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Can't open in Photoshop"
- Make sure you're using Photoshop CC or later
- Try: **3D → New 3D Layer from File**
- Check that 3D features are enabled in Preferences

### "No colors showing"
- Vertex colors require Photoshop CC 2014+
- Try opening in Blender to verify colors exist
- Make sure you're opening `terrain_simple.obj`

### "File too large"
- Use `DOWNSAMPLE = 2` in script for smaller file
- Or `DOWNSAMPLE = 4` for even smaller

## ✨ Summary

**Your working files are ready!**

1. Open `terrain_simple.obj` in Photoshop
2. Or import `terrain_simple.stl` for 3D printing
3. Both files have proper colors from your zonemap
4. No external dependencies needed

The QGIS export had structural issues (negative indices, external texture) that prevented proper display. The new files have colors baked directly into vertices for maximum compatibility.
